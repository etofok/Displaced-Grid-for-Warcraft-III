;----------------------

"IMAGE_OVERLAY.png" is a 1920x1080 transparent image.

Displaced Grid overlays this image directly on top of the Warcraft III:Reforged window.

Name must be "IMAGE_OVERLAY.png"



If you DO NOT play in 1920x1080 - you DO need to adjust the overlay.
Otherwise it won't be properly aligned.


Use the provided "IMAGE_OVERLAY (for editing).psd" in this folder.
.psd - is a Photoshop file.
You can open in an online editor ("edit .psd online").


Here's a detailed instruction:

1. Open "IMAGE_OVERLAY (for editing).psd" in Photoshop or any online .psd editor.

2. Paste your in-game screenshot (as a temporary reference) and align the overlay on top of it.

3. Don't forget to remove the in-game screenshot before exporting.

4. Export as .png to keep the transparency. Do not export as .jpg.

5. The overlay image should be named exactly "IMAGE_OVERLAY.png". Do not name it any differently.

P.S. Save the .psd file as well just in case you'll need to get back to it later.

That's it!
