;----------------------

"IMAGE_OVERLAY.png" is a 1920x1080 transparent image.

Displaced Grid overlays this image directly on top of the Warcraft III:Reforged window.



If you play in a different resolution than 1920x1080 - you need to adjust the overlay.

Use the provided "IMAGE_OVERLAY (for editing).psd" in this folder.



1. Open "IMAGE_OVERLAY (for editing).psd" in Photoshop or any online .psd editor.

2. Paste your in-game screenshot (as a temporary reference) and align the overlay on top of it.

3. Don't forget to remove the in-game screenshot before exporting.

4. Export as .png to keep the transparency.

5. The overlay image should be named exactly "IMAGE_OVERLAY.png".

P.S. Save the .psd file as well in case you'll need to edit it later.

That's it!
