"DisplacedGrid_Overlay.png" must be a 1920x1080 transparent image. 

Displaced Grid places this image over your Warcraft III: Reforged window. 
It will only work if named "DisplacedGrid_Overlay.png". 

If you don't play at 1920x1080, you'll likely need to adjust the overlay for proper alignment.



Use the provided "DisplacedGrid_Overlay (for editing).psd" in this folder.

.psd - is a Photoshop file.

You can open it in an online editor (just google "edit .psd online").


Easy Steps for Overlay:

1. Open "DisplacedGrid_Overlay (for editing).psd" in Photoshop or an online .psd editor.
2. Grab an in-game screenshot and paste it here as well.
3. Align the overlay over the screenshot.
4. Delete the screenshot layer before saving (!).
5. Save the overlay as "DisplacedGrid_Overlay.png" (.png is required, not .jpg).
6. Save the .psd file for future edits.

Restart Displaced Grid so that the new image is cached.

That's it!
